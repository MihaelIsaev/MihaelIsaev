### Greetings, traveler of code 👋

Welcome to my sanctuary of Swift – a space where ideas flow like streams, and code becomes art.

I’m the creator and keeper of **Swift Stream IDE**, along with a constellation of Swift frameworks and libraries ✨

My journey through the realms of programming began in 2004.  
In 2010, I embraced the mobile frontier.  
And in 2014, I found my true path – Swift – and it has been my compass ever since ❤️

Through the years, I have **transcended** the syntax and semantics of many tongues: C, Objective-C, Swift, Java, JS/TS, Python, and beyond.  
Yet Swift is where my soul resides — expressive, powerful, elegant.

I wield Swift across dimensions: [iOS/macOS](https://github.com/MihaelIsaev/UIKitPlus), [Android](https://github.com/swifdroid/), [web](https://github.com/swifweb/), [server-side](https://github.com/vapor/), and [embedded](https://github.com/apple/swift-embedded-examples).  
The boundary between platforms dissolves when the language is right.

- 📖 Forever evolving – knowledge is the path, not the destination
